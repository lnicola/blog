The manufacturer allows you to download your data by logging in to their web dashboard, going to settings, and choosing "Download my data". In 10 minutes or so, you will get a ZIP archive in your inbox.<h2 id=the-withings-data>The Withings data</h2><p>I like to take long walks and I'm currently living in a small suburb near a larger city, so most of my walks were around the town. Let's look first at the format of the data. There are 38 CSVs and a small <code>README.txt</code>:<pre style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code><span> 303790 Jan  8 12:01 activities.csv

</span></code></pre><p>The <code>XXX</code>s are not in the original files, I've (quite pointlessly) masked the digits after the decimal point. I don't think we care about the durations, but the timestamps are not monotonic, which might matter later. Fortunately, the timestamps appear to be correlated across the two files. Otherwise it would be quite annoying to match the two values. On the other hand, we have some weird-looking entries:<pre style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code><span># raw_location_latitude.csv

</span></code></pre><p>At first sight, those might appear to be two measurements merged into one entry, as the duration seems legit. But the second coordinate values are clearly bogus. There are no entries with three values, and those with a single one don't have any outrageous outliers. So whatever these are, we will make sure to ignore them.<p>I won't show any code now, but let's extract the points from there, open <a href=https://qgis.org/>QGIS</a> and check whether the values (for one arbitrary day) appear to be correct:<p><a href=/assets/gps-points.webp target=_blank><img src=/assets/gps-points.webp></a><p>Yes, there are a couple of outliers but overall it's fine.<h2 id=map-matching>Map matching</h2><p>My hope was to match these points to road segments obtained from OpenStreetMap data. It took me a while to stumble across a way to do this, but I managed to find the <a href=http://project-osrm.org/>OSRM</a> project. OSRM is open-source and they have a demo web service, but the strict query length limitation made trying it a was of time.<p>Looking at the docs, we find the <a href=http://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.24.0/api/#match-service><code>match</code></a> endpoint. It takes a set of coordinates and returns a list of route legs corresponding to them. You can see an example if you follow the previous link.<p>I found a couple of sites that offered OSM exports, but couldn't figure out quickly how to register for an API key. In the end, I downloaded a <code>pbf</code> file for my whole country from <a href=https://data.osm-hr.org/>https://data.osm-hr.org/</a>. It was quite small, at 247 MB.<p>In order to use OSRM, we need to do some pre-processing steps, and also pick a profile. <code>foot</code> is a good choice here because I don't care about one-way streets and passable barriers.<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a;>$</span><span> docker run</span><span style=color:#bf616a;> --rm -t -v </span><span>$</span><span style=color:#bf616a;>PWD</span><span>:/data osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract</span><span style=color:#bf616a;> -p</span><span> /opt/foot.lua /data/romania.osm.pbf

</span></code></pre><p>On my computer this took 33 seconds and used about 3.1 GB RAM at its peak. Now we can start the OSRM routing service:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a;>$</span><span> docker run</span><span style=color:#bf616a;> --rm -p</span><span> 5000:5000</span><span style=color:#bf616a;> -v </span><span>$</span><span style=color:#bf616a;>PWD</span><span>:/data osrm/osrm-backend osrm-routed</span><span style=color:#bf616a;> --algorithm</span><span> mld</span><span style=color:#bf616a;> --max-matching-size</span><span> 5000 /data/romania.osrm
</span></code></pre><p>It's a bit weird, but <code>match</code> also expects a profile. It doesn't seem to matter (as you would expect, since we picked a profile during the pre-processing), and this was slightly confusing. Does it work?<p><a href=/assets/gps-tracks-bad.webp target=_blank><img src=/assets/gps-tracks-bad.webp></a><p>No, that's not great. I tried a couple of things: displaying all the matched legs, changing the profile (I originally used the wrong one), sorting the points by timestamp, and even including the timestamps in the request:<p><a href=/assets/gps-tracks-better.webp target=_blank><img src=/assets/gps-tracks-better.webp></a><p>This is much better. What if we also use the location accuracy, available in the <code>raw_location_horizontal-radius.csv</code> file from the archive?<p><a href=/assets/gps-tracks-not-better.webp target=_blank><img src=/assets/gps-tracks-not-better.webp></a><p>This slows down the matching from "apparently instant" to almost 90 seconds, and introduces some errors. Looking at the accuracy radius values, most of them are around 10 m, but some have suspicious values like 600 and 800 m. Let's keep the points with accuracy better than 50 m:<p><a href=/assets/gps-tracks-better-again.webp target=_blank><img src=/assets/gps-tracks-better-again.webp></a><p>With the old output in green, you can see that most of the extra segments are now gone. But some are still missing and this confused me quite a bit until I looked at the OSM data.<p>Hint: don't try open a <code>pbf</code> file directly; you can use <a href=https://gdal.org/>GDAL</a> to convert it to a format with spatial index support:<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a;>$</span><span> ogr2ogr romania.osm.gpkg romania.osm.pbf
</span></code></pre><p><a href=/assets/gps-tracks-osm-gaps.webp target=_blank><img src=/assets/gps-tracks-osm-gaps.webp></a><p>It's hard to see in the image, but there's a visible gap near the top-left corner. Could my OSM export have been too old? Looking at that site again, the other files are from 2018. My download probably triggered an update, since now the <code>pbf</code> shows a timestamp from today.<p>I searched for other ways to get the OSM data and <a href=https://download.geofabrik.de/>Geofabrik</a> seems to be more popular. Let's see how it looks:<p><a href=/assets/gps-tracks-new-osm.webp target=_blank><img src=/assets/gps-tracks-new-osm.webp></a><p>Unfortunately, some segments are still missing or wrong, even though this time they are present in the OSM data. Checking one of them, it had an <code>access => private</code> tag, which makes sense. There are some residential buildings with barriers and I might have passed near some of them without noticing it wasn't allowed.<p>The <code>foot</code> profile has a list of blacklisted tags:<pre class=language-lua data-lang=lua style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-lua data-lang=lua><span>    </span><span style=color:#bf616a;>access_tag_blacklist </span><span>= </span><span style=color:#bf616a;>Set </span><span>{

</span><span>      '</span><span style=color:#a3be8c;>forestry</span><span>',

</span><span>      '</span><span style=color:#a3be8c;>delivery</span><span>',
</span><span>    },
</span></code></pre><p>I removed them, re-ran the OSRM pre-processing, and re-did the matching:<p><a href=/assets/gps-tracks-not-bad.webp target=_blank><img src=/assets/gps-tracks-not-bad.webp></a><p>The missing segment is a foot path through an uncultivated area between two recently-built apartment buildings:<p><a href=/assets/gps-photo.jpg target=_blank><img src=/assets/gps-photo-thumb.webp></a><p>But overall it's quite decent, so I guess this is it for today. Thanks for reading if you got to the end.<p>In the next post, I will try to show these tracks in a more interesting form.<p><em>Map data from <a href=https://openstreetmap.org/copyright>OpenStreetMap</a></em></div></div>
