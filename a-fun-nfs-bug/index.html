Today I spent a bit of time debugging an issue related to the NFS gateway, so read on for more — and for a twist at the end.<h2 id=something-is-broken>Something is broken</h2><p>I have a workload which involves relatively many of those images at once, accessed through the <a href=https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse><code>s3fs</code></a> FUSE helper (a way to make an S3 bucket look like a file system). For some reason, sometimes requests start failing after a while, and using NFS is a way to work around that.<p>But something strange was happening today when I was trying to use the NFS share. One version of <a href=https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/>GDAL</a> was able to read the files, while another, older one, complained they were invalid and wasn't able to open them. Using <code>s3fs</code>, both GDAL versions worked fine.<p>This made me think that NFS is returning corrupted files (maybe with some junk at the end), and the newer GDAL was able to ignore that. But on a closer look, both <code>s3fs</code> and NFS returned identical (up to a checksum, at least) files. This was the cause of some head scratching, since reading a the same file from different places should yield the same results —<h2 id=my-favourite-tool>My favourite tool</h2><p>— unless maybe it shouldn't? This story seemed fishy and I broke out what's probably my favourite debugging tool, <code>strace</code>. <code>strace</code> sets breakpoints on every interaction of a program with the operating system (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call>system call</a>) and displays the request involved, including the arguments. So, for example, if Linux a program tries to open a file, it will show up in <code>strace</code> as an <code>open</code> or <code>openat</code> call.<p><em>Note: if that sounds interesting and you want to know more, check out <a href=https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/04/14/strace-zine/>this zine</a> and <a href=https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/04/03/what-problems-do-people-solve-with-strace/>this article</a>. And if you're not using Linux, you can try <a href=https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon>Process Monitor</a> or <a href=http://dtrace.org/blogs/about/>DTrace</a>.</em><p>So I gave <code>strace</code> a try (edited for brevity):<pre class=language-bash data-lang=bash style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=color:#bf616a;>$</span><span> strace gdalinfo /mount_nfs/path/to/file.jp2 </span><span style=color:#65737e;># old GDAL

</span></code></pre><p>Most of the output above isn't too important, but the last <code>open</code> calls fail with <code>EPERM</code>, which sounds like a good reason to not work. If you have trouble reading the log, the full sequence is:<ul><li><code>gdalinfo</code> checks the file length and attributes<li><code>gdalinfo</code> opens the file<li><code>gdalinfo</code> checks the length and attributes of the open file<li><code>gdalinfo</code> reads 8 KB from the file, which works, then rewinds to the beginning<li><code>gdalinfo</code> tries to open the file again and gets a permissions-related error<li><code>gdalinfo</code> tries to open the file again and gets a permissions-related error</ul><p>Sure, this is a bit redundant, but it doesn't matter that much when you're reading 115 MB. Note how the first <code>open</code> call works, then but the next ones fail.<p>In contrast, the newer GDAL works because it only tries to open the file once. So what's wrong, can we only read files once?<p>Of course not, otherwise a second <code>gdalinfo</code> wouldn't work. So a better theory is that we can't open the same file twice. And now that we have a theory, we can try to confirm it using <del>Rust</del> just kidding, let's use Python this time:<pre class=language-python data-lang=python style=background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#65737e;># open the file once, works

</span></code></pre><p>So yeah, our theory was correct. I don't know what kind of server we're dealing with, but it doesn't let us open any file multiple times. It even fails — maybe not surprisingly — if we're opening it from different processes.<p>I wasn't able to find any reports of a similar problem, so one of my reasons for writing this is to make it available to search engines.<h2 id=the-solution>The solution</h2><p>I also happened to stumble upon a pretty simple workaround: add <code>nfsvers=3</code> to the mount options (<code>/etc/fstab</code>). It appears that the problem only occurs when using NFSv4, and not NFSv3.<h2 id=a-final-twist>A final twist</h2><p>All this sounded somewhat familiar, so I searched through my inbox and found I had already reported this to the cloud provider in March 2020. I even took a <code>tcpdump</code> capture and found out that the server was returning <code>NFS4ERR_PERM</code> on the failing call:<blockquote><p>This indicates that the requester is not the owner. The operation was not allowed because the caller is neither a privileged user (root) nor the owner of the target of the operation.</blockquote><p>But don't confuse this with <code>NFS4ERR_ACCESS</code>:<blockquote><p>This indicates permission denied. The caller does not have the correct permission to perform the requested operation. Contrast this with NFS4ERR_PERM (Section 13.1.6.2), which restricts itself to owner or privileged user permission failures.</blockquote><p>Hear this, Google? If you've got a weird NFS server that doesn't allow you to open files a second time and yields <code>NFS4ERR_PERM</code>, try downgrading to NFSv3.<p>And no, the provider never answered back.<hr><p>By the way, if your files sometime go away or can't be reopened, please consider <a href=https://www.buymeacoffee.com/lnicolaq>buying me a coffee</a>.</div></div>
